# trv-matrix

This project contains 3 parts: coded, genmtx, matrix.

Part coded: This uses the Hill Cypher algorithm to apply a matrix to encrypt and decrypt a message.

Part genmtx: This generates a matrix that can be used in the Hill Cypher.

Part matrix: This has various arithmetic functions to apply on 1 or more matrices and produces a matrix solution.

Rebuilding this project requires the "EagleSun-Library-in-C" project.
